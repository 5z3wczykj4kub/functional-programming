# Contributing to "Introduction to Functional Programming"

Contributions should have generally the goal of making the original author's content more digestible or fixing typos/language.

Pull Requests are welcome if they comply with the aforementioned goal.

The spirit of these edits should never lose the mathematical and theoretical rigor required for all of us to speak a common, well-defined language: no monads as burritos or functors as boxes.

Adding valuable brand new content is welcome too, but will likely be linked as accompanying material in order to not diverge from the original content.

Changing the meaning of laws or definitions requires opening an issue and, if possible, will need Giulio's approval. Any of these contributions should be backed by sound mathematical and theoretical foundations which means that "but in _insert functional language_ this is different" is not enough of an argument as the goal here is to translate mathematical ideas into TypeScript, not debate specific implementations.

In Layman terms: just because X language does something in some way it doesn't mean that the laws and math behind that should be assumed as general laws.
